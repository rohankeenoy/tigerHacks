It takes your top tracks over the last 6 months and uses your quiz answers to create the best roadtrip playlist for traveling the starts or the states!</p>

        <p> In order for this to work correctly, make sure your local host is the same as mine. If not, go setup a dev account and insert your client secret, id, and redirect URI in the matching variables at the top. In the real world, we would hide these behind php wrapper functions and a server. If using your own spotify dev account, make sure the redirect uri in your browser and your dev profile is the same to make it work. Please let me know if you have any difficulties getting it to work on your machine. I wanted to push myself to try to make something 100% on the client. </p>
